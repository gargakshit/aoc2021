# My advent of code solutions for 2021

_Please don't judge my code kthnkx_

This time I decided to go with [livebook](https://livebook.dev) and
[elixir](https://elixir-lang.org). To run my solutions (why would
you tho):

- Install livebook
- Run the livebook server
- Connect to the `mix project` runtime in livebook
- Open `lib/day_<number>.livemd` in livebook
- Evaluate the cells!
